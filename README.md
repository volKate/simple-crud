To run this app you need to follow next steps:

- clone repo to your local machine
- run `npm install` in terminal to install dependencies
- run `npm run start:dev` if you want to start application in dev mode. Change any file in `src` folder and see if the app is re-run.
- run `npm run start:prod` to build the project. It will start on port `8005` (specified in .env) OR `8004` if there is no .env file.

When the app is successfully started, check the endpoints using any tool you like, e.g. Postman.

To run tests simply do `npm run test`
